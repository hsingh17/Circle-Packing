# Circle Packing Art
Simple Python program that uses PyGame to create Circle Packing Art, as shown below

# Motivation
I saw a YouTube video by [The Coding Train](https://youtu.be/QHEQuoIKgNE) where he does the same thing, but in Processing. I only saw the first couple minutes and thought it looked interesting so I attempted to make my own. 

# Installation 
Before running the program, we must install:
1. Python3
2. PyGame

## Python3
To install Python3 through the terminal, run the following:

`$ sudo apt-get update`

`$ sudo apt-get install python3.6`

For Windows, follow this [link](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).

## PyGame
To install Pygame through the terminal, use the following (skip to second line if PIP is already installed):

`$ sudo apt install python3-pip`

`$ pip3 install pygame`

Or you could go to the [PyGame website](https://www.pygame.org/news)

# Usage
To use the program, either run

`$ python3 CirclePacking.py`

or

`$ chmod +x CirclePacking.py`

`$ ./CirclePacking.py`

**Note: The animation opens in fullscreen do not be alarmed**

# Controls
1. `Q` to quit
2. `P` to pause the animation
3. `S` to screenshot of the animation *(saved to the same directory as the program)*
4. `C` to continue the animation
5. `R` to restart the animation *(only when not paused)*
